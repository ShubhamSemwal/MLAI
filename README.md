# Breast Cancer Detection

Our model make predictions for the breast cancer, if its malignant or benign by analyzing the breast cancer data set.

**Data Set** :
Training data - BREAST-CANCER-TRAIN-R.csv
Testing data - BREAST-CANCER-TESTR-W.csv

**Variables** : numeric-valued and represent measurements from digitized histopathological images of a fine- needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy

ID - Integer ID number
CLUMP - clump_thickness: (1-10). Benign cells tend to be grouped in monolayers, while 
cancerous cells are often grouped in multilayers.  
CELL_SIZE - cell_size_uniformity: (1-10). Cancer cells tend to vary in size and shape.
CELL_SHAPE - cell_shape_uniformity: (1-10). Cancer cells tend to vary in shape and size.  
ADHESION - marginal_adhesion: (1-10). Normal cells tend to stick together while cancer cells tend to lose this ability, so the loss of adhesion is a sign of malignancy.  
EPITHELIAL - single_epithelial_cell_size: (1-10). It is related to the uniformity mentioned above. Epithelial cells that are significantly enlarged may be a malignant cell. 
BARE - bare_nuclei: (1-10). This is a term used for nuclei not surrounded by cytoplasm (the rest of the cell). Those are typically seen in benign tumors.  
BLAND - bland_chromatin: (1-10). Describes a uniform "texture" of the nucleus seen in benign 
cells. In cancer cells, the chromatin tends to be more coarse and to form clumps.
NORMAL - normal_nucleoli: (1-10). Nucleoli are small structures seen in the nucleus. In normal cells, the nucleolus is usually very small if visible at all. The nucleoli become more prominent in cancer cells, and sometimes there are multiple.  
MITOSIS - mitoses: (1-10). Cancer is essentially a disease of uncontrolled mitosis.  
CLASS - diagnose: (2 or 4). Benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) lump in a breast.
